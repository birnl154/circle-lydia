    <b>The Bardini reading</b> I found to be a bit dull in terms of just a lot of factual statement, however the ideas touched upon in the reading themselves were not boring. One aspect I also thought about is how much money it took for the presentation to take place and how it was funded in part by the government. This brings in broader questions of government spending: what is the US government willing to spend on the advancement of technology? Could that money be spent in other areas for better use? Further, one of the presenters said that the funders were pretty hands-off when it came to determining what the funding was spent on. This could be beneficial as it allows for more creative freedom and accomplishments such as the <time>1968</time> presentation. On the other hand, it would be easy for the money to be misspent if put into the wrong hands.

       <b>I</b> have no idea how to answer this cause I was having major concentration issues with the reading but i do like to think that things would still technologically evolve it would just look different.
